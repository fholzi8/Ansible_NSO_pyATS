# nso-5-day-training


This training was prepared by Cisco IT Network Engineers for other network engineers. It requires no background in NSO, YANG, Python or anything else.

You will need a working copy of NSO to play around with, the examples assumed using NSO 4.4. For some of the service template examples, you may need to use the same version of the cisco-ios NED ( version 5.2.7) to get the XML to look the same.

The backbone of the content is in the [Lecture Notes PDF File](/LectureNotes). All of the labs are based off of the content given in the lectures.

This course includes:
- Automation Culture slides (some taken from Kirk Byers NANOG, with credit)
- Beginning / intermediate Yang
- NSO + Python Maagic API
- XML(taken from W3Schools mostly with credit) REST API usage
- building a package without config
- building a service package
- intermediate service templates
- All with Enterprise relevant examples (QoS, ACLs, NTP servers, etc).
