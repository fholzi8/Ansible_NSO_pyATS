TCL Scripts onto the Router

Keep in mind nowadays you can use a good programming language <b>python</b> instead of <b>tcl</b> but onto the old classical C2960 or above it was more or less the only option.

And also doing so is in my view a nightmare in administration and management of the cosistency and reliablity because distributing all scripts onto each device.
It could make sense, if you don't have a centralized server or so but then buy a raspberry pi.

As mention I did this over 10 years ago and I was young and naive.
